      <p>If you ever ask yourself, where can you see the most pristine dark skies in the
world? Well, I&rsquo;m lucky enough to work in one of those places; in the middle
of the desert, where humidity levels on average are less than 20%, and no
civilization is in sight.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/tailscale/ut4.jpg"  class="center"  style="height:500px"  />


<p>I work as a Software Engineer over there, since the workplace is <em>literally</em> in
the middle of the desert, we usually work in shifts, I arrive on a Tuesday, and
stay until the next Tuesday, over +1.000km away from my home.</p>
<p>That means I get to live in the middle of nowhere for a week, in a (rather
nice) residency with a good enough internet connection. I don&rsquo;t possess a
gaming laptop, but I do have a somewhat decent desktop rig at my place, and I
wondered, <em>how hard could it be to setup anything to do remote gaming nowadays,
considering the birth (and death) of some cloud gaming services?</em></p>
<p>I wanted to do this while exposing as little of my home network to the
internet, and with this requirement in mind, I discovered
<a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. So far, I&rsquo;ve been impressed by their
offerings, including supporting over 50+ devices on their free tier!</p>
<p>With this great tool, you can basically host any service you want within your
VPN (<em>in the true sense of VPN</em>), without fiddling with port routing, domains,
exposing your public IP, etc.</p>
<p>The next logical step was to search for a tool to stream my desktop with fairly
low latency, and for that I discovered
<a href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine">Sunshine</a>, which works similarly
to how the NVIDIA shield used to &mdash; by using HW accelerated encoding if available.
Setting this up was quite straightforward; you can just check their <a href="https://docs.lizardbyte.dev/projects/sunshine/latest/md_docs_2getting__started.html">getting
started</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a> is basically the client for Sunshine
(or NVIDIA experience if you have that). This application runs almost anywhere &ndash;
it was even ported for the <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/Moonlight-Switch">Nintendo
Switch</a>! I also tested their app
for the LG TVs and to my surprise, I was able to plug-in directly a controller
to the TV and play as well.</p>
<p>During the gameplay I felt it was quite stable, I usually saw 27ms of
latency with ~2ms of variance, and the plot shows a somewhat similar value too:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/tailscale/ping.png" alt="ping results"></p>
<p>Of course, since I&rsquo;m running all my games on a desktop, it is not optimal to
leave it running all the time, since its idle power consumption is&hellip;
non-negligible, I then arrived to a very cheap solution: Wake-On-Lan with an
ESP32.</p>
<h2 id="esp32-to-the-rescue">ESP32 to the rescue</h2>
<p>I know some routers support Wake on Lan natively, but sadly, after testing mine
and researching online, I found that in my case, it was not possible. I could
upgrade to a better router, or instead&hellip; I could spend a measly USD $3 for a
computer that could fulfill this specific requirement.</p>
<p>Since I suffer a small case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH
syndrome</a>, I decided to
experiment a bit on the topic myself, and instead of using an out of the box
solution, I implemented my own. I wrote a very simple WOL broadcaster in
Arduino&rsquo;s programming language, <a href="https://gist.github.com/etra0/b82e2e25cb86962f2999efe5e328f43a">that you can get from here</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first time experimenting with these devices, I&rsquo;ve always had an
interest in embedded systems, and although I personally don&rsquo;t consider this an
&rsquo;embedded&rsquo; project, I was still amazed at how much you can do with these
<em>teeny</em> devices.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-caveat">The big caveat</h3>
<p>As I said earlier in this post though, I wanted to do this exposing as little
as possible from my network. However, it&rsquo;s currently not possible to run Tailscale
on a ESP32, which makes sense, these devices are tiny in the true sense of that
word (<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/5220">although I think there are some current efforts on getting that
running</a>), so, to overcome
this <strong>big</strong> limitation, and since I already owned a domain in Namecheap, I
opted for using their DDNS (which it <em>is</em> supported by the router), and open a
single port to the internet, with this, I could simply do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;my_passphrase&#34;</span> | nc my.domain.com <span style="color:#ae81ff">9999</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and boom! the PC will turn on.</p>
<p>I know, the code you saw before and this method is <em>by no means</em> secure at all,
but the worst they can do is just turn on my pc! <em>(famous last words I guess)</em>,
but, if you ask me, this is a big win over having my big pc ON all the time
consuming more power than it should!</p>
<p>To get all this working, I had to do some changes in Windows as well, I
followed the <a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/WOL-%28Wake-On-LAN%29">moonlight
guide</a>
which worked quite well for me.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Of course, at the end of the day, all of this could have been simply solved by
buying a laptop with a GPU, after all, I don&rsquo;t play very intensive games
nowadays&hellip; but, my commute is of around 8 hours 4 times a month, and carrying
a bulky laptop <em>plus</em> the working laptop&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t sound too attractive to me.</p>
<p>Also, with this I gain other benefits, like for example, I can access my own
jellyfin installed at home, and use my own IP as exit node!</p>
<p>I hope you learned something from this small read, or at least had fun, I
certainly had while writing this (and setting this up!) Pardon any grammatical
mistake, my first language is <em>not</em> English (as you can see from the rest of
this blog) :).</p>
