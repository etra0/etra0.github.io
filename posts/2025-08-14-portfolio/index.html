      <p><em>Warning: English is not my native language and I refused to ask an LLM to write
this for me, so at least you got a somewhat human blogpost in exchange for some
bad english :P</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an interest in photography for a long time, I remember being
fascinated by it in highschool and since then I still enjoy looking at
pictures, reading about photography (<del>suffering from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gear_acquisition_syndrome">GAS</a></del>) and most of all, taking
pictures.</p>
<p>During all this time, different social networks were born to showcase
photography: Flickr, 500px, and in my opinion, the most active one, Instagram –
but the latter has lost its main focus, it&rsquo;s not longer about sharing photos,
but rather a lifestyle (real or not). Stories, Reels, people rarely posts
nowadays and I believe interactions with posts took a dip.</p>
<p>Despite this, I&rsquo;m still active in Instagram, I share pictures as posts and also
I share some more &lsquo;fancy&rsquo; snaps on stories focusing on composition.</p>
<p>For quite a while, I wanted to build some sort of
<a href="https://portfolio.etra0.cl">portfolio</a>. Nothing
professional, I don&rsquo;t expect having gigs as a photographer, after all, I do
this on my free time and for pure enjoyment, but I wanted to have a more
&lsquo;curated&rsquo; site to post some of my favourite pictures, but never caught the time
to do it myself. I remember looking everywhere for a good Jekyll or Hugo
template, but those I&rsquo;ve found, none convinced me, therefore I always put on
hold the idea of doing it.</p>
<h2 id="my-ai-take">My AI take</h2>
<p>Honestly, at this point you might be pretty tired of hearing what AI can do,
one-shot prompts, build your SaaS and generate profit™ as quick as possible,
break everything, <em>move fast!</em></p>
<p>And so am I. My usage so far has been more of peer programming, sometimes I
find it really useful, and sometimes it feels like a waste of time, like I was
fighting someone incredible intelligent yet stupid at the same time.</p>
<p>My problem is, I don&rsquo;t have much skill building front-ends, I&rsquo;ve done my fair
bit of javascript (never enjoyed it), but I have more interest in the back-end,
infra, and low level stuff, therefore I needed a <em>lot</em> of help if I
wanted to build something anew.</p>
<p>In this case in particular, it is an utilitarian usecase, I mostly cared about the
tool I wanted rather than to build it myself, because I wanted to focus on
curating my pictures and having a place to display it, rather than getting
excited on building it myself.</p>
<h3 id="vibecoding-it">Vibecoding it</h3>
<p>So, I tried it. From using it mostly as a peer programming tool, I asked the
tool to write most of the app.</p>
<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>I wanted something I could host statically, didn&rsquo;t want to have a CMS, and
wanted to have as much reduced costs as I could.</p>
<p>I had previous experience using Hugo (admittedly, on a very superficial way,
never truly built something myself), for the pictures I wanted to use Backblaze
+ Cloudflare for some caching (and since I handle my DNS there already), and
so, I started with what I believe was a very simple prompt onto ChatGPT (4o):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to create a static website using hugo to host my portfolio. The page
should be pretty minimal, with a sidebar with different categories (for
example, black and white, color, film, etc.) and for each category I should
have a carousel. I want to store the images on blackblaze, therefore I can
provide urls per category, and maybe some metadata, I was thinking on using a
yml for such a thing but I&rsquo;m open for suggestion.</p>
<p>Create the whole project for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, this gave me a decent enough start. Of course, it generated a very
barebones site, but it did stick to most of my requirements.</p>
<p>One of the first changes I asked it to do, is to have the categories and the
metadata in one single file, it previously generated a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.yml +
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.md, but after a few messages, I was able to unify them.</p>
<p>The workflow, though, got annoying really quick. Since I was using ChatGPT
through its site, I
had to ask every few prompts to generate a zipfile for me that I could download
and test and see how things are going, and every time I did a change, had to
copy-paste the code, then ask it to change the thing I needed.</p>
<p>I believe this process could have been faster using any of the fancy IDEs there
are available, Zed, Cursor, I don&rsquo;t know what else, but since I code on nvim
(don&rsquo;t even have installed vscode), I moved forward with this workflow until it
got <em>too</em> annoying.</p>
<h4 id="deploying-the-first-version">Deploying the first version.</h4>
<p>After I had a first (barebones) working version, I used github pages to
deploy it, did all the DNS shenanigans to have it hosted on my specific URL and
well, there it was, doing what I asked to, my personal display of my work.</p>
<p>The site was not mobile friendly, it was a bit rough, but goal achieved, I
guess?</p>
<h4 id="refining-the-site-and-the-workflow">Refining the site and the workflow.</h4>
<p>Since I had the site hosted on github pages, and the code on, <em>well</em>, github, I
wanted to give github codespaces a shot, because it&rsquo;s there, and the few times
I had to use it, it was good enough to do quick changes.</p>
<p>To my <del>un</del>surprise, the vs code it launched, had AI tools integrated as well.
So this time, I tried the <em>&ldquo;chatting and applying&rdquo;</em> workflow, and oh wow, it was so
much better and fluid.</p>
<p>After some more back and forward, I think I achieved somewhat what I was
looking for:</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/portfolio/website.jpg"  class="left"  />


<p>I know, I could have tried a more refined tool from the beginning, or <em>maybe try
a tool you could have suggested me if I asked</em>, but honestly, I don&rsquo;t expect
making this my main workflow, so for this usecase, it was pretty fine!</p>
<p>Despite achieving something better than I expected (maybe my goals were too
low? heh), working with an LLM is&hellip; <em>exhausting</em>.</p>
<p>It might have been my lack of skills on writing specifications, I did all of it
in English which is not my native language, and unless you&rsquo;re very specific, it
will sometimes do things you didn&rsquo;t expect. It felt very messy, sometimes it
suggested big changes, it was difficult to keep track of all the changes, and
at some point it just become a process of&hellip; just accepting the suggestions and
see what happens.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t audited most of what it wrote, because it kept changing stuff, and it
felt hard to go back when you changed something and it didn&rsquo;t result on what
you expected, and from time to time I had to do manual changes to the CSS file
myself anyway because after trying several times explaining what I <em>actually</em>
wanted, it never really captured it.</p>
<p>Despite achieving what I wanted, in a very short timespan (I think I totalled
around 8 hours of work, which is crazy low to build an entire site from scratch
in my opinion), I felt very tired, it was not very fun, but the result was
there rather quickly.</p>
<p>We might get replaced, or we might be forced to integrate this workflow on our
day to day, but my conclusion is, despite being useful, it is <em>not</em> that fun,
most of the code went unaudited (which can&rsquo;t/shouldn&rsquo;t be accepted on a
professional workplace!) and honestly, I hope to do it as less as possible.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-config-file-looks-like">How does the config file looks like</h4>
<p>So, basically, the main configurability of the sites are the categories and how
do you show the images. They&rsquo;re under</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>./content/categories % ls
black-and-white.md color.md           film.md            wildlife.md
</code></pre><p>And the files have a very basic file structure:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>categories % cat black-and-white.md
+++
title = &#34;Black and White&#34;
images = [
  { url = &#34;&lt;url&gt;/DSCF3112.jpg&#34;, caption = &#34;Caption 1...&#34; },
  { url = &#34;&lt;url&gt;/DSCF3123.jpg&#34;, caption = &#34;Caption 2...&#34; },
  { url = &#34;&lt;url&gt;/IMG_3999.jpg&#34;, caption = &#34;Caption 3...&#34; },

]
+++
</code></pre><p>So, it still requires a bit of manual work, I have to manually upload the
pictures to somewhere, and edit the markdown file to add  the image and the
caption.</p>
<p>But, adding new categories, changing their titles, changing the captions, is
pretty trivial! and all of it running on a static site.</p>
<h4 id="hosting">Hosting</h4>
<p>For the site hosting, as I mentioned, I&rsquo;m using github pages with a custom
subdomain. Configuring this is pretty trivial, HTTPS comes basically for free,
and on every push, the site gets rebuild and deployed automatically by a very
basic github action.</p>
<p>For the images, I decided to go with Backblaze because I used previously with
another project. To reduce a bit the costs, I followed this <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-deliver-public-backblaze-b2-content-through-cloudflare-cdn">great
tutorial</a>
from Backblaze themselves, so the pictures can get cached through Cloudflare
proxy, reducing actual hits to the bucket and making it a little bit faster.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, yeah. This is a very personal goal I wanted to achieved, and if
I didn&rsquo;t have this tool available I would probably never done it myself. I
won&rsquo;t generate a dime out of it, and it made me realize how few pictures I had
that I really like, therefore it pushes me to shoot more! and since then, I&rsquo;ve
taken my camera with me to more places.</p>
<p>Quality has not magically improved, I&rsquo;m not a better photographer because of
it, but my core goal was completed — I <em>want</em> to shoot more, I <em>want</em> to
improve my photography skills, because now I have a place where to showcase
them.</p>
<p>Things could be better, I think the image loading stuff is still slow (I
think it is because it cannot calculate the grid until images are loaded,
but I like this kind of grid!), and things could be improved, but I was able to
get where I wanted, with minimal effort on the javascript side, at the cost of
having to fight a very smart/dumb tool.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I had to build something bigger, with more states, sub-services,
etc. I don&rsquo;t see myself using AI full time, it is slow, it produces a lot of
changes too quickly and it&rsquo;s easy to get lost on what you were asking to, and
it also required being a bit more &rsquo;techy&rsquo; on asking for specific stuff so with
knowledge on the damain, certain things were easier.</p>
